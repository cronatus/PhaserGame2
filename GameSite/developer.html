            <h1><u>Developers insight</u></h1>

            <p>
                Mark Williams (B00265222) : Programming, Web design and Minor documentation work.
                <br><br>
                Daniel Burke (B00291776) : Animation, Puzzle Design, Main documentation and Testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mark Wrote the program for the game using Phaser on Webstorm, while familiar with Webstorm
                He only began learning to use the Phaser Framework a few weeks before beginning this project.
                He also designed the web page including the way it works and looks.
                He designed the code and fixed bugs in the game to ensure that the game worked as intended.
                He also helped fill in anything that was missed in the documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Daniel completed the documentation for this game as well as created the designs of the puzzles and the short animations in the second puzzle
                He looked at many different puzzles and chose to work with ones which where easy to look at,
                looked relatively challenging and then choosing several to adapt to a new way which could be more complex or possibly simpler.
                He strived to complete the documentation to a professional standard as well as create the short animations as well.
                He was also the primary tester of the puzzles as he knew how they were supposed to work
                and was not directly involved in the development of the codebase for the puzzles.
                making him more likely to identify bugs as well as want the puzzles to work correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
                While both developers had their own specific roles, both developers had a hand in every aspect of the development.
                we both worked together to ensure that most aspects worked ,looked and felt the way we wanted them to.
                our aim for this project was to create a game that could be enjoyable.
            </p>

            <p>
                In reflection, the game that we created seems simple.
                Something that anyone could do in hindsight. creating a game, even one like this is difficult.
                Both of us did what we could to get the game across the way they wanted it however compromises where sometimes necessary.
                In the end we created a game that we both like and that hopefully others would as well.
            </p>
