                This website is here to show some of the skill that the designers have and the game that they made.
                Below is a quick description of the game that we created and a small piece on each of the designers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game that we created is a puzzle game where the players complete three different puzzles.
                The first puzzle is a recreation of the magic square puzzle, as its title tells.
                The second puzzle is a remake of an old puzzle, the three goddess'.
                The last one is there to test the player's general knowledge.
                If you want to know more about the disengage go to the design tab.
            </p>
                The designers are Daniel Burke and Mark Williams, We created the game using the different skills that each of us had.
                Daniel designed and created the puzzles and the small animations while Mark Programmed the Puzzles and menus.
                To find out more about us and our individual roles go to the developers tab.
